# First-Project---Simple-CRM
This is my first real unguided project. The aim was to create a very simple CRM. In this project, there is a simple HTML form that accepts some data. Upon submitting the form, a Java Servlet handles the data and stores it in a text file. This data can then be read and filtered through using a navigator terminal application.
